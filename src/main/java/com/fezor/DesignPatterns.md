Design patterns are solutions for common problems in software design.

Pattern Description:
- Intent of pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution;
- Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible
- Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related
- Code example in of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern

**Creational Patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Structutral patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient;

**Behavioral  patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of resposibilities between objects.
